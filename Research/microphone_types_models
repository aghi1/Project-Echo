//RESEARCHING MICROPHONE TYPES FOR ENVIRONMENT/WILDLIFE 

// (1)	SENNHEISER MKH 8000 SERIES

        -SUMMARY: The MKH 8000 line of RF condenser microphones, which are more dependable, long-lasting, and precise than conventional AF condenser microphones, were developed by Sennheiser. MKH 8000 RF condenser microphones are remarkably sensitive and noise-free, enabling audio professionals to record crisp, clear sound in almost any setting, from concert halls to jungles and all points in between. Through the integration of radio frequency technology into wired microphone architecture, the MKH 8000 series offers distinct benefits not seen in conventional AF condenser microphones. 

        --The RF condenser concept is how MKH 8000 microphones attain their exceptional sensitivity and wide frequency range. The diaphragm of traditional AF condenser microphones is pre-tensioned to a single electrode by the polarisation voltage, making it rigid. However, the MKH 8000 microphones have a low-tension diaphragm that can be held securely and steadily between two symmetrical electrodes thanks to a constant 8 MHz AC current flows.

`       DETAILS: 

        --Bass Response - A wide response range is possible all the way down to the lowest frequencies thanks to the low-tension diaphragm's superior low-frequency response compared to traditional stiff diaphragms.

        --Treble Range – Up to 50 kHz, which accurately captures transient responsiveness and fine detail in sound.

        --High efficiency and low self-noise - Acoustic damping of the mid frequencies is required to achieve a linearized frequency response with traditional condenser microphones with rigid diaphragms, which results in a loss of efficiency. Its ability to directly replicate every frequency throughout the whole spectrum of its audio response produces a sound that is extremely lifelike and has a high sound efficiency.

        --Clear, consistent sound without off-axis coloration - Acoustic filters are used to generate the pick-up patterns of traditional condenser microphones, which results in off-axis coloration of the sound. However, this eliminates the need for filters, resulting in a realistic and coherent sound image.

        --Low non-linear distortion - preserves acoustic clarity by avoiding the addition of new frequency spectra.

        --Robust in challenging conditions – The microphone capsule's continuous RF current flow evaporatively removes moisture by nature, rendering it perfect for usage in damp settings.


    // (2)	Clippy EM172 or 272 microphone

        -SUMMARY: 
        --The Micbooster firm manufactures the Clippy, a lavalier or clip-on microphone. Primo EM172 or EM272 microphone capsules are used with it, and it is also another type of condenser microphone. Compact and reasonably priced, the Clippy lavalier microphone is ideal for a range of field recording applications. However, its sound quality is not as clear as that of more costly professional models.

        -DETAILS: 

        --Affordable - The Clippy is a compact, low-cost microphone that works great for field recording, particularly for collecting recordings of the surrounding environment and wildlife.

        --Average sound quality - The sound quality of the Clippy is a little "bright" or "tinny" when compared to more costly professional microphones; this may need to be adjusted with EQ. Nonetheless, considering the cost, it offers good performance and value.

        --Size and profile - Because of its compact size and low profile, the Clippy is easy to position and conceal, making it a handy tool for sound walks, stealth recordings, and capturing urban atmospheres and even in challenging environment.

        --Low-fidelity - The sound quality of built-in smartphone or camera mics can be significantly improved with the Clippy, even though it is not as high-fidelity as expensive microphones. It's a well-liked option for novice field recordists on a tight budget.



// (3)	LOM mikroUsi

        -SUMMARY: 
        --The LOM mikroUši are a combine of compact, high-quality omnidirectional electret condenser amplifiers planned for field recording and stereo recording. While exceptionally delicate, a few clients note they may need a bit of high-frequency reaction compared to more costly receivers like DPA 4060s. But for the cost, the LOM mikroUši give a reasonable way to capture high-quality stereo recordings within the field. 

        -DETAILS:

        --Compact Size and Noise - Greatly little estimate at as it were 6.8mm in distance across and 24mm long, making them perfect for watchful recording and near mic'ing of sound sources. Moo self-noise of around 20dBA, giving a clean flag for capturing calm and sensitive sounds. 

        --High Sensitivity and Stereo - Tall affectability of -32dB at 1kHz, permitting them to choose up black out sounds clearly. The combine is stereo-matched for precise stereo imaging when utilized as a coincident match. 

        --Power and Connectivity - Ghost fueled from 2-10V, permitting them to be utilized with versatile recorders like Sound Gadgets, Zoom etc.  3.5mm (1/8") yield jack interfaces straightforwardly to recorder inputs. 1.5m cable length on each mouthpiece. 

        --Applications - Perfect for recording fragile nature sounds, city ambiences, wearing occasions where nuances in tall frequencies are less basic. Can be utilized for binaural recording by mounting on glasses/earbuds. Exceeds expectations at near mic'ing of sound sources due to minor measure.
